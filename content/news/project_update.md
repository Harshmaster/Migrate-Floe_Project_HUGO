The Floe team has been involved in a number of activities recently:

We have been collaborating with OER Commons in several areas:

- helping to ensure that OER Commons is accessible to all learners and educators,
- integrating the Infusion User Interface Options component into OER Commons, and
- contributing to the design and development of Open Author.

Our development team is also working on a fully accessible, open source HTML5 video player. You can try the demo.
